# Prototype Stack

## Motivation

As frontend grows in complexity, we're reminded of simpler times with server-rendered HTML. At the same time I've grown to really love the composability of React components.

My hope is that this is a viable web stack, where I can put all of the domain logic in one place. Regardless of it's a first render, or responding to a request.

## Stack

- Go
- Tailwind
